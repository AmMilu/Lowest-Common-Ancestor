# Lowest-Common-Ancestor
This includes three part of software engineering tasks.
1. Lowest Common Ancestor - in master - using Java and test by JUnit 5
   To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree. 
2. Lowest Common Ancestor - in branch - using Java and test by JUnit 5
   To enhance the previous LCA solution, implementing as a branch that must ultimately be merged with master branch, and implementation of LCA that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form.
